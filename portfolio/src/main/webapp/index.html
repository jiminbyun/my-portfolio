        <h1>Jimin Byun</h1>
        <p> Hello! I am Jimin. I'm 19, rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science. 
            I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence with additional major in Computer Science. 
            While I enjoyed every new things I learned in school, some of best courses for me was Computer Vision, Planning Teachniques for Robotics and Parallel Algorithms. 
            I am originally from Seoul, South Korea, although I spent most of my post elementary school years in small island called Jeju. 
            I came to United States for the first time as a college freshman, so my experience and knowledge about US is limited to Pittsburgh, specifically within 10km radius around our school. 
        </p>

        <p> In my free time, I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles while marathoning a movie or tv series. 
            My friends and I spend most of our time together playing board games or going to Room Escapes. 
            Contrary to my other hobbies, I also play drum kit for fun, especially for upbeat songs. (Not that I'm good at it)
