	<p> Meet Dukgu, traditional Korean Jindo dog. He just turned 2 years so he is very young.
		He was very small when he first came, and our family sort of thought he would stay that way for a while, but he
		grew exponentially every week; still he is super adorable.
		Jindo dogs are typically hunter dogs so are very smart and loyal, but our dog is different.
		He doesn't know whether there is a stranger in the house until someone reaches to our front door.
		He often skips meal because he is scared of mouse near his food tray (He eats right after we remove mouse for
		him).
		He also can't play catch because when I throw a ball, he runs to it and fetches it, but instead of giving back
		he constantly runs around with it in his mouth until he gets tired, which then he just lies down.
		Still, he was the best addition to our family.
